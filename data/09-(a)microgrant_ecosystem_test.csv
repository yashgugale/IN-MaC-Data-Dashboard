""The great Roman leader Julius Caesar recorded the earliest known version of this proverb, 'Experience is the teacher of all things,' (52 B.C.). This quote has endured for centuries and few involved in education would disagree. Experiential education is a philosophy in which educators purposefully engage with learners in direct experience and focused reflection in order to increase knowledge, develop skills, clarify values, and develop people's capacity to contribute to their communities. The Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) World Class Manufacturing Academy (WCMA) Indiana team launched a highly successful K-12 Workforce Development program in the local county school systems. Forty percent of the Indiana workforce for FCA, both hourly and salary, will become retirement eligible in the next 5-10 years. This bubble of competence exit will directly affect the 5 local transmission/casting plant workforce. In order to be proactive in developing interest and educational pathways that can successfully prepare current students to fill these advanced manufacturing positions, the WCMA team designed and executed a workforce development program (see attachment). Requests from multiple local schools for program activities have indicated an interest among educators for opportunities to enhance their knowledge of manufacturing. As knowledge increases with hands on experiential education, attitudes regarding modern manufacturing will be enriched, skill sets will be expanded and aspirations toward career exploration in manufacturing will expand. FCA World Class Manufacturing Academy (WCMA) is submitting a proposal for an ""EDUCATION-WORKFORCE PARTNERSHIP PLANNING GRANT"". The purpose of the planning grant is: · To design and test a pilot program for elementary educators in Tipton and Howard Counties that will give educators 2 days of paid, hands-on, work-based learning in a FCA Advanced Manufacturing Facility. · Develop project for educators to design and manufacture a item (desk name plate, tool box, hammer) using manufacturing methodology; mentored by FCA skilled employees and registered ‘trade’ apprentices (RA). · To create an awareness for elementary educators, administrators, counselors of Advanced Manufacturing within North Central Indiana through Experiential Education at a Central IN FCA Advanced Manufacturing Facility. · To dispel myths of the world of Advanced Manufacturing. · To generate interest and enthusiasm for career education exploration for students in the STEM and Advanced Manufacturing industry. • This FCA WCMA Pilot program model will be conducted, evaluated, altered and offered to teachers in the FCA region as an experiential education and career readiness in-service.

Primary Education,9,St. Louis Catholic School Robotics and Enrichment Program,Ripley,"17 East St. Louis Place, Batesville, IN","The purpose of our robotics program is for our students to use science, math and cooperation in building the robots to achieve a common goal. During the competitions, students have to work together, with students from other schools they have just met, to complete a mission and score points for their team. The enrichment program allows students to shadow or take part in a class they do not have access to during school hours. We would like to increase our classes by adding auto mechanics, diesel technology, robotics, and engineering, by using our local manufacturing companies and having them come to our school to conduct a class and for our students to be able to travel to their company for a field trip.",310,"$2,000 ",https://www.st.louisschool.org/,959.2081255,38.55379291
Primary Education,9,St. Marys Catholic School,Decatur,"1331 East Hunter Robbins Way, Greensburg, IN ","The purpose of this project is to provide students with Markerboard Top Tables and additional STEM Lab materials. The tables are adjustable in height and have wheels for ease of movement around the room. My goal with new tables in the STEM room is to develop closer collaboration with groups while also creating a diverse learning space. Additional STEM lab materials we would purchase include: wooden dowel rods, plastic straws, Styrofoam, and other potential items. Our goal in the classroom is to think about our world around us. How does our community affect us? But also, how do we affect our community? I want our students leaving St. Mary’s asking the big questions, finding pathways of understanding, and being able to communicate their findings. When collaborating in the classroom we work on leadership skills. Receiving materials like the Marker Board Top Tables will allow students to better use their leadership skills, no matter if it is a small or large group setting. Currently in the classroom, students are creating Energy Robot sketchs. During this project we take a look at the World around us and observe the types of energy that we use day-to-day. After Spring Break students will begin a challenge with building structures. We look at different types of building structures around our area, especially our new school that was built 7 years ago. By taking what we see around us and using it in our own way, on a smaller scale, it gives students a better understanding of “What and Why” of building projects. Students will use given materials to collaborate with their group on building a structure. The end goal of this project is to have students solve a given problem by brainstorming what changes need to be made to make their structure a success. With additional funds we can purchase materials for this challenge. No matter if students choose higher education or workforce when they leave school, they can be more successful on either path when they learn to put their collaboration skills into practice like they do in the STEM classroom. This would be a wonderful opportunity for all St. Marys students in their STEM journey. Thank you for your consideration.",128,"$2,000 ",https://school.stmarysgreensburg.com/,789.7475014,145.9095052
